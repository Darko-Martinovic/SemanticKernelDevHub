Meeting Transcript: PLU Analysis Discussion
Date: June 29, 2025, 2:00 PM
Duration: 45 minutes
Participants: Farid, Christopher, Darko, Nikola

Farid: Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining the PLU analysis meeting. We need to discuss the recent findings from the GK API data and plan our next steps.

Christopher: Hi Farid. I've been reviewing the preliminary data and there are some interesting patterns emerging. The PLU codes are showing unexpected variations across different store locations.

Farid: That's exactly what I wanted to discuss. Christopher, can you walk us through what you've found so far?

Christopher: Sure. Looking at the JSON data from the GK API, we're seeing PLU inconsistencies in about 15% of the records. Some items have multiple PLU codes for the same product across different stores.

Farid: This is concerning. How significant is the impact on our inventory management system?

Christopher: It's quite significant. The mismatched PLUs are causing reconciliation issues and affecting our stock level accuracy. We need to implement a standardization process.

Farid: Good point. Do we have the resources to tackle this immediately, or should we prioritize it for next quarter?

Christopher: I think this is urgent, Farid. The data inconsistencies are growing, and if we don't address them soon, it'll become a much larger problem.

Farid: Agreed. Let's assign this as a high-priority task. Darko and Nikola, I'd like you both to analyze the PLU JSON data from the GK API and come up with a standardization strategy.

Christopher: That sounds like a good plan. Should we also look into automated validation rules to prevent future inconsistencies?

Farid: Excellent suggestion, Christopher. Let's include that in the scope as well. We need both a fix for the current issues and prevention for future ones.

Christopher: I can help with the validation logic once Darko and Nikola complete their analysis. We should also consider implementing alerts when new PLU inconsistencies are detected.

Farid: Perfect. So to summarize: Darko and Nikola will analyze the GK API PLU data, develop a standardization strategy, and then Christopher will work on the validation and alerting system.

Christopher: Sounds good. What's our timeline for this work?

Farid: Given the urgency, I'd like to see the analysis completed within two weeks, and the validation system in place by the end of next month.

Christopher: That's achievable. Should we schedule a follow-up meeting to review progress?

Farid: Yes, let's meet again next Friday to check on progress and address any blockers.

Christopher: I'll send out a calendar invite for next Friday at the same time.

Farid: Excellent. Any other questions or concerns about the PLU analysis project?

Christopher: No questions from me. I think we have a clear path forward.

Farid: Great. Thanks everyone for your time and focus. Let's make this PLU standardization a success.

Christopher: Thanks, Farid. Talk to you all next week.
