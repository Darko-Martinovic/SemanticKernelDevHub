Meeting Transcript: Promotional Bug Analysis
Date: June 29, 2025, 3:30 PM
Duration: 30 minutes
Participants: Sarah, Mike, Alex, Jennifer

Sarah: Hi everyone, thanks for joining on short notice. We have an urgent promotional bug that's affecting our weekend sale campaign.

Mike: What's the situation, Sarah? I saw some reports coming in but haven't had a chance to investigate yet.

Sarah: The promotional discount codes aren't applying correctly for customers. Instead of the advertised 25% off, some customers are getting 50% off, and others are getting no discount at all.

Alex: That's a serious issue. Do we know how many customers have been affected?

Sarah: From the initial reports, it looks like about 200 orders in the last 6 hours. The financial impact could be significant if we don't fix this quickly.

Jennifer: I can look into the promotional code logic. Mike, can you check the database for any recent changes to the discount tables?

Mike: Absolutely. I'll run a comparison against yesterday's data to see what might have changed.

Sarah: Good. Alex, can you handle customer communications? We need to proactively reach out to affected customers.

Alex: Of course. Should I offer compensation for the customers who didn't receive their discount?

Sarah: Yes, let's make it right for our customers. Offer them the correct 25% discount plus a small goodwill credit.

Jennifer: I found something. There's a conflict in the promotional code rules. Two campaigns are overlapping and causing the calculation errors.

Mike: That explains the inconsistent behavior. Jennifer, can you disable the conflicting campaign temporarily while we fix the logic?

Jennifer: I can do that right now. Give me two minutes to implement the hotfix.

Sarah: Perfect. Once that's done, Alex, please send out apology emails to the affected customers with their corrected orders.

Alex: Will do. Should I also post an update on our social media channels to address any public complaints?

Sarah: Good thinking. Keep it brief and professional - acknowledge the issue and confirm it's been resolved.

Jennifer: Hotfix is deployed. The promotional codes should now be working correctly. I'm monitoring the system to confirm.

Mike: I see the database changes. Everything looks correct now. New orders should process with the right discount.

Sarah: Excellent work everyone. Alex, please keep tracking customer feedback over the next few hours to make sure we haven't missed anything.

Alex: Absolutely. I'll also coordinate with customer service to brief them on the situation in case customers call in.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's reconvene tomorrow morning to review the full impact and discuss how we can prevent similar issues in the future.

Jennifer: I'll prepare a technical postmortem document for tomorrow's review.

Mike: And I'll compile the data on affected orders and financial impact.

Sarah: Great. Thanks everyone for the quick response. This could have been much worse without your fast action.
