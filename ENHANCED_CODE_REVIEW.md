## ðŸš€ **Implementation Impact**

### **Before Enhancement:**
```
Basic review comment example:
"Issues Found: Variable naming could be improved"
```

### **After Enhancement:**
```
Comprehensive review comment example:
"### Critical Issues & Bug Analysis

**Naming Convention Violations (High Priority)**:
The variable `d` on line 15 violates C# naming conventions and significantly impacts code readability. 

**Specific Issues:**
- Single-letter variable names make code maintenance difficult
- Missing context about the variable's purpose
- Violates Microsoft C# Coding Conventions for descriptive naming

**Recommended Fix:**
```csharp
// Before (Poor)
var d = DateTime.Now.AddDays(30);

// After (Improved)
var expirationDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(30);
var subscriptionEndDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(30); // Even more specific
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Improves code maintainability for team members
- Reduces debugging time when issues arise
- Enhances code review efficiency
- Supports automated refactoring tools

**Estimated Effort**: Low (5-10 minutes per file)
**Business Impact**: Reduces future maintenance costs and onboarding time
```
